# ATM-project
This is a ATM simulator made in Java made for my Computer Science 2 class.

The purpose of the project was to simulate an ATM where the user had to input certain ID's in order to access the ATM and view balance and perform other types of processes.

Class TestAccount is the driver class where everything was being called to, while Class Account is where the methods and other error checking was involved.
